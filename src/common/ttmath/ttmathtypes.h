    \brief constants used in the library
    
    As our library is written in header files (templates) we cannot use
	constants like 'const int' etc. because we should have some source files
	*.cpp to define this variables. Only what we can have are constants
	defined by #define preprocessor macros.

	All macros are preceded by TTMATH_ prefix

	TTMATH_DEBUG
	this macro enables further testing during writing your code

	is not fulfilled (look at the definition of TTMATH_ASSERT and TTMATH_REFERENCE_ASSERT)

	TTMATH_RELEASE
	if you are confident that your code is perfect you can define TTMATH_RELEASE
	macro for example by using -D option in gcc
	 gcc -DTTMATH_RELEASE -o myprogram myprogram.cpp 
	or by defining this macro in your code before using any header files of this library

	if TTMATH_RELEASE is not set then TTMATH_DEBUG is set

		Some kind of methods use a reference as their argument to another object,

			UInt<2> foo(10);
			foo.Add(foo);
