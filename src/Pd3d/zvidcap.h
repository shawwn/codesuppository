// This is a fascade around the incredibly poorly designed
// DirectShow API for Video Capture.
//
// This API is not intended to be all things to all people 
// (which is exactly the problem with the DirectShow API).
// Instead it should do most of what you want with minimal hassle
// If nothing else, it is a good starting place for more 
// complicated solutions.
//
// This code is MEMALLOC_FREE with no strings attached and no warranty.
