// This is a very useful code snippet that will generate an arrow head as a set of triangles.
// The arrow head is nicely shaped, with a slightly hollowed interior which makes it easier to
// visualize when flat-shading.  By default it generates a 24 triangle arrow head at 30 degree
// increments.
//
// Consider the line segment P1 to P2.  This will generate the geometry for a nice looking arrow head
// oriented correctly at the tip of P2.  Great for indicating ray segments.
//
// Usage:
//
//           p1    - is a const NxF32 pointer to the starting position of the ray (x,y,z)
//           p2    - is a const NxF32 pointer to the ending position of the ray, this is where the arrow head will go.
//arrowHeadSize    - this is the size of the arrow head.  If this is greater than 1/3 the length of the p1 to p2, it the arrow head will be shrunk to fit the line segment.
//       tcount    - a reference to an NxU32 that will contain the number of triangles produced by the routine.
//
// returns an array of const floats in the form of x1,y1,x1, x2,y2,z2, x3,y3,z3 9 floats per triangle.

const NxF32 * createArrowHead(const NxF32 *p1,const NxF32 *p2,NxF32 arrowHeadSize,NxU32 &tcount);


// Here is an example demonstration of how to use the function:
//
//
//    NxU32 tcount;
//    const NxF32 *triangles = createArrowHead(p1,p2,1,tcount);
//    for (NxU32 i=0; i<tcount; i++)
//    {
//      debugSolidTri(triangles,triangles+3,triangles+6,0xFF0000);  // debug this triangle solid shaded in red
//      debugWireTri(triangles,triangles+3,triangles+6,0xFFFFFF);   // overlay a white wireframe outline on top of it.
//      triangles+=9;
//    }
