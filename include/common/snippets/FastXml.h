// This code snippet provides an extremely lightweight and fast XML parser.
// This parser only handles data elements as if they were streamed data.
// It is important to note that all pointers returned by this parser are
// persistent for the lifetime of the FastXml class.  This means you can cache
// copies of the pointers (rather than copying any data) if this matches your
// needs.


// Simpy call createFastXml to get a copy of the FastXml parsing interface
// To parse an XML file, have your application inherit the pure virtual
// interface called 'FastXmlInterface' and implement the single method 'processElement'
//
// For each element in the XML file you will get a callback with the following
// data.
//
// 'elementName' the name of the element (this pointer is persistent)
// 'argc'  The total number of attributes and values for this element.
//         The number of attribute/value pairs is equal to argc/2
// 'argv'  The attribute/value pairs in the form of attribute/value, attribute/value..
//         These pointers are persistent and can be cached if needed (until FastXml is released)
// 'elementData' optional data (i.e. text) associated with the element.  If this is a null pointer
//         then the element had no data.  This pointer is persistent.
// 'lineno'  The line number in the source XML file.
//
// After calling your routine 'processElement' you must return 'true' to continue parsing
// If you want to stop parsing early, return false.
//
// If the call to process an XML file fails, it will return false.
// You can then call the method 'getError' to get a description of why it failed
// and on what line number of the source XML file it occurred.
