//***********************************************************************************
//*** This code snippet allows you to embed a telnet client or server easily into any
//*** of your applications.  Currently this code only builds for Windows and the XBOX
//*** It is very desirable to me to have this code build for APPLE, Linux, and Iphone
//*** If you wish to contribute to this cause, please let me know and I will add you
//*** as a developer to the google code page.  http://code.google.com/p/telnet
//***
//*** To test the program simply run 'telnet.exe'.
//***
//*** The first time you run it, it will be set up as a telnet server.  You can
//*** connect to it by runing a telnet client and typing 'open localhost 23'
//*** If you run the program a second time, it will detect that a server is already
//*** using Port 23 and will instead start up as a client.  You can now send messages
//*** between the two instances of the application.
//*** You can keep launching as many of them as you wish.
