//** This header file defines two types of lock-free ques.
// The first is a standard circular queue of a fixed size that supports
// a single reader and a single writer.  It does no locks, or interchange instructions.
//
// The second is intended to be a lock-free queue that supports access from
// multiple threads simultaneously. 
//
// The lock free queue implementation was written by David Pangerl
