//** Random number class and Random number pool class.  This acts as a
//** replacement for the stdlib rand() function.  Why would you want to
//** replace the rand() function?  Because you often want a deteriminstic
//** random number generator that is exactly the same regardless of what
//** machine or compiler you build your code on.  The stdlib rand() function
//** is not guaraenteed to produce the same results on different stdlib
//** implementations.
//**
//** You can also maintain any number of unique random number generators
//** as state machines by instancing this rand class over and over again.
//**
//** The random number pool is a data structure which you allocate if you
//** want to pull items from a data set, randomly, but without any
//** duplications.  A simple example would be a deck of cards.  You would
//** instantiate the random number pool as follows:
//**
//** RandPool deck(52);
//**
//** You would then pull cards from the deck as follows:
//**
//** bool shuffled;
//** int card = deck.Get(shuffled);
//**
//** This will return a number between 0-51 (representing a card in the deck)
//** without ever reporting the same card twice until the deck has been
//** exhausted.  If the boolean 'shuffled' is true, then the deck was
//** re-shuffled on that call.  This data structure has lots of uses in
//** computer games where you want to randomly select data from a fixed
//** pool size.
//**

//** It is released into the public domain on the same date.
